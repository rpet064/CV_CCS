# This website is a public website introducing me as a programmer and giving some background about my skills, expertises and knowledge.

# It is intended to be created as a static website to focus on developing CSS skills.

# 15-01 - was updated to be responsive to mobile devices. 
# When screen width is <1100px - the top cloud covered the title - the bottom cloud also didn't fit in with the flow of the document.
