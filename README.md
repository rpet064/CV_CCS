# 15-01 - Website purpose
The purpose of this website is to introduce me as a developer.
It is intended to be a static website with no functionality to improve CSS skills. 

# 15-01 - was updated to be responsive to mobile devices. 
When screen width is <1100px - the top cloud covered the title - the bottom cloud also didn't fit in with the flow of the document.
Therefore a query was added to adjust size and position of the cloud images

# 15-01 - A bug was fixed 
Where images weren't showing up due to incorrect directory name. Windows doesn't care about incorrect capitalization in directory names, but Github uses Linux system and therefore will be unable to locate image.
